The purpose of this repository is to:

* Explain the importance of requirement analysis in SDLC.
* Provide templates, examples, and best practices for effective requirement gathering.
* Serve as a reference for developers, analysts, and students to understand how clear, complete, and validated requirements contribute to building robust and scalable software solutions.
